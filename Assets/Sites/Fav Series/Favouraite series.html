<p>
  This is based on an Indian spy named srikant, he workes to keep his nation safe while he manages his family matters and growing children.
  He is an exeptional officer in the NIA. The story is divided in two parts. This is a must watch.

</h3>

<p>
  This is the best series According to me. This is a legal drama, based on a legal firm in manhattan, NY.
  The main character in this is Harvey Spectar, hi is "Best closer in the city" and he is a very inspiring character.
  I like his qoutes too much. Some exampels are "Winners don't make excusses." and "I don't have dreams, I have Goals".
